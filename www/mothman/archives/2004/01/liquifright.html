<h3 class="title">liqui-fright</h3>

<p>here's a story of dubious authenticity about<br />
liqui-fruit, the person who forwarded it to me<br />
didn't even include 'Mandy Bijl''s email address</p>

<p>couple things<br />
i) the tone was very off:<br />
 'We phoned Liqui Fruit helpline who immediately wanted to send out a driver to   collect the evidence (abviously to destroy it immediately),'<br />
 'Pick' n'Pay in   turn gave us a free Liqui Fruit (whoopie).'<br />
 <br />
ii) 'After the scare last year with Pick 'n Pay' which turned out to be nothing but the greedy and the paranoid.</p>

<p>iii) those 'lumps' look heavy, surely noticable before you poured it out</p>

<p>iv) kids just happened to be there when it gets poured out? and they had been drinking it already, how coincidental.</p>

<p>v) 'last   bit to find green lumps of (goodness knows what) at the bottom<br />
growing rapidly' ... if the picture is to go by, that would have come out before the 'last bit' and WTF is 'growing rapidly' supposed to mean ...</p>

<p>vi)  'This Liqui Fruit was bought at Pick 'n Pay on December 4 2003, with an<br />
expiry   date of 10 April 2004.' odd range of dates there</p>

<p>right, onto the crap ...<br />
(I /WILL/ buy liqui-fruit again, just like i drink pop rocks and vanilla coke, and<br />
my head doesn't explode)</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>As we all enjoy Liqui Fruit, it sure aint funny when you pour out your<br />
last   bit to find green lumps of (goodness knows what) at the bottom<br />
growing<br />
rapidly. This was poured in front of family members for specifically<br />
children,   who had already had some to drink out of the carton.</p>

<p>This Liqui Fruit was bought at Pick 'n Pay on December 4 2003, with an<br />
expiry   date of 10 April 2004.</p>

<p>We phoned Liqui Fruit helpline who immediately wanted to send out a<br />
drivert o   collect the evidence (abviously to destroy it immediately),<br />
they offered<br />
to   send vouchers which we accepted at the time, but to date (19<br />
January<br />
2004)   they have still not arrived.<br />
 <br />
We then approached Pick 'n Pay (the assistant who helped us was totally<br />
horrified) whom in turn contacted Liqui Fruit, Liqui Fruit said that the<br />
vouchers would be on their way in another week (still waiting), Pick' n<br />
Pay in   turn gave us a free Liqui Fruit (whoopie).<br />
 <br />
We are still waiting for Pick 'n Pay Helpline to get back to us after<br />
contacting them on Thursday 16 January2 004.</p>

<p>After the scare last year with Pick 'n Pay, you would think that they<br />
would   remove the whole batch (we don't know if they have), but we sure<br />
hope<br />
that they did.</p>

<p>Have a look at the attached photos for yourself.  Will you buy Liqui<br />
Fruit   again???</p>

<p>Please forward to all you know whom you think should know.</p>

<p>Mandy Bijl - concerned customer </p>
