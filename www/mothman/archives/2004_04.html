<p><strong>Walking Alone On the Sandy Beach</strong><br />
<em>Words by Robert Alberg.</em></p>

<p>I'm Walking Alone On the Sandy Beach<br />
as the sun begins to rise in the eastern<br />
sky to another day being alone as<br />
I'm Walking Alone On the Sandy Beach<br />
with the driftwood, and the rocks, and<br />
the sand, and the seashells that I see<br />
here on this isolated sandy beach<br />
. I'm Walking Alone On the Sandy Beach<br />
as I hear the sound of the waves as I see<br />
the waves coming onto the sandy beach<br />
as the sand becomes so wet</p>

<p>I'm Walking Alone On the Sandy Beach<br />
as I hear a fog whistle whistling nearby<br />
warning ships at sea of the dangerous<br />
seashore as</p>

<p>I'm Walking Alone On the Sandy Beach<br />
and I been Walking Alone On the Sandy<br />
Beach as I been Walking Alone on<br />
the Sandy Beach</p>

<p>I'm Walking Alone On the Sandy Beach<br />
as the sun begins to set in the western<br />
sky as the clear blue sky changes into<br />
a orange colored sky as the sun sets<br />
while I'm Walking Alone On the Sandy<br />
Beach</p>

<p>I'm Walking Alone On the Sandy Beach<br />
as the sun disappears over the horizon<br />
and the moon rises as I see a reflection<br />
of the moonlight on the ocean water<br />
while I'm Walking Alone On the Sandy Beach<br />
.</p>

<p><strong>Sand Storms</strong><br />
<em>Words by Robert Alberg</em></p>

<p>I can see the sand storms on the sandy beach<br />
while the sand is being blown across the<br />
sandy beach in a sand storm as the sand storms<br />
are blowing all the sand around on the sandy<br />
beach by the ocean water</p>

<p>I can hear the whistling sound of the sand<br />
all around me as I'm walking on the sandy beach<br />
as the whistling sound sounds like a howling<br />
sound of the sand as the Sand Storms are<br />
blowing all the sand around on the sandy beach</p>

<p>It's so windy out here on the sandy beach<br />
with all the wind blowing all the sand all around<br />
while I'm walking on the sandy beach as the<br />
sand storms are blowing all the sand around<br />
on the sandy beach<br />
.</p>

<p>I can see the sand storms on the sandy beach<br />
while the sand is being blown across the<br />
sandy beach in a sand storm as the sand storms<br />
are blowing all the sand around on the sandy<br />
beach by the ocean water<br />
.</p>

<p>Oh the sand is being blown all around on the<br />
sandy beach in the sand storms by the ocean<br />
water as the sand is being blown all across<br />
the sandy beach as I'm walking along the<br />
ocean water.</p>

<p>I can see the sand storms on the sandy beach<br />
while the sand is being blown across the<br />
sandy beach in a sand storm as the sand storms<br />
are blowing all the sand around on the sandy<br />
beach by the ocean water.</p>

<p>It's so windy out here on the sandy beach<br />
with all the wind blowing all the sand all around<br />
while I'm walking on the sandy beach as the<br />
sand storms are blowing all the sand around<br />
on the sandy beach.</p>

<p><strong>Martian Sands</strong><br />
<em>Words by Robert Alberg</em></p>

<p>As the Martian Sands begin to blow all around<br />
on this red planet as I see a red martian sunrise<br />
as the sun begins to rise as I'm walking along<br />
on the martian sand on this forbidding planet.</p>

<p>I'll be waiting for more Martian Sands as<br />
I'll be waiting for more Martian Sands as<br />
the night has come, and<br />
I'll be waiting for more Martian Sands as<br />
I'll be waiting for more Martian Sands</p>

<p>As I been walking and the martian sands are<br />
blowing all around me as I see the red martian<br />
landscape before me as I'm walking on the red<br />
martian landscape and the red martian sunrise<br />
gives way to another day on this forbidding<br />
planet.</p>

<p>As the red martian sands are blowing all<br />
around me as I'm walking on the red martian<br />
landscape as I been walking all day on the<br />
red martian landscape as the sun begins to set<br />
in a red martian sunset as the sun slowly begins<br />
to fade off in the distance and the red martian<br />
landscape disappears into the cold darkened<br />
night on this forbidding planet as I'll be waiting<br />
for another red martian sunrise<br />
.</p>

<p>I'll be waiting for more Martian Sands as<br />
I'll be waiting for more Martian Sands as<br />
the night has come, and<br />
I'll be waiting for more Martian Sands as<br />
I'll be waiting for more Martian Sands</p>

<p>As I been walking and the martian sands are<br />
blowing all around me as I see the red martian<br />
landscape before me as I'm walking on the red<br />
martian landscape and the red martian sunrise<br />
gives way to another day on this forbidding<br />
planet.</p>

<p>As the red martian sands are blowing all<br />
around me as I'm walking on the red martian<br />
landscape as I been walking all day on the<br />
red martian landscape as the sun begins to set<br />
in a red martian sunset as the sun slowly begins<br />
to fade off in the distance and the red martian<br />
landscape disappears into the cold darkened<br />
night on this forbidding planet as I'll be waiting<br />
for another red martian sunrise.</p>
