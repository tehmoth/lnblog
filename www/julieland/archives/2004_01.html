<h3 class="title">New Look</h3>

<p>James and I had a flashback moment this weekend when we were looking at the link listed below.  Atari totally ruled our young lives in the late 70s, early 80s.  So that would be why you see this very slick new background. </p>

<p>What you are seeing is the beginning of my new website.  I am completely revamping the thing.  Mostly because I'm bored outta my noggin.  Still gonna have the old links, a couple new ones and of course, all about me.  :)  Enjoy it and look forward to the new stuff coming soon!!!!!</p>

<h3 class="title">Happy New Year...or is it?</h3>

<p>Okay so we here in South Africa have gone over to the new year....2004....My friends and family back home still await that exciting hour...but is it going to be as happy as they expect?</p>

<p>Right...I'm reading all these horrific articles on news.google.com and cnn.com and other various news sites.  I cannot believe what Las Vegas is gonna be like tonight.  Armed police lining Las Vegas Blvd., Snipers on the roof tops, BlackHawk helicopters and warplanes flying over downtown Las Vegas.  New York City has about the same, DC and Chicago also have extra security and also, 28 planes flying all over California to protect the power grids and water supply.  What on earth has this world come to?</p>

<p>This stuff is so sad to me it makes me want to just cry.  Some people would argue that this was caused by Osama Bin Laden, others would say GWBush...I say it's a combination of both.  I think it's good that the governments are more caring of their citizens now, but it's like there is this control that is blanketed over everyone.  I don't know how to describe it.  It just seems so wrong.  </p>

<p>Anyway, midnight on the west coast of the United States is at 10am Thursday morning South Africa time.  I'll be HOPEFULLY awake or at least dreaming anyway.  If something happens in the world, I'll find out when i get up.</p>

<p>For now, I am off...luv you all, be safe and Happy New Year!!!! :)</p>
