<h3 class="title">One more smoke before bed</h3>

<p>I am getting super sleepy, but I'm having one last smokie before bed.  Also, James and I are watching last week's episode of The Office.  That show is so politically INCORRECT.  It's absolutely hysterical.  Some of the shit they say & do is so wrong but I can't help watching because it's so funny.</p>

<p>So another good day at work.  Mine & Tony's numbers are coming up which is soooooo damn good.  Otherwise we'd be in tons o' trouble.</p>

<p>Anyway, off to bed!  Night!</p>

<p>Julie :)<br />
ps.  Have you ever wondered why nobody keeps penguins as pets?  </p>

<h3 class="title">The friends</h3>

<p>I've got four very good friends that I work with.  The four of them keep my days going.  Working in a call center can be very annoying and stressful.  Talking to random idiots who can't figure out how to work a remote control or children wanting to download porn onto their new handheld game.  </p>

<p>Here's the cast of friends....</p>

<p>My only close girlfriend at work and in Las Vegas....introducing the one, the only,  Laura Sokol!!!  She was one of my first friends in Las Vegas & Clientlogic.  When she and I were promoted together as Mentors we were on our way to becoming the best friends two people can be.</p>

<p>Anyway, she married her husband two weeks before James and I got married and of course, both of us being newly married, have lots and lots in common.  Now she's 6 months pregnant and still the bestest friend I could ever ask for.</p>

<p>I think my favorite thing that she's done was take my advice about asking her husband if she can hold his penis while he pees.  Her husband FREAKED out and continues to freak out.  I LOVE IT!!!  </p>

<p>Next on the list is Mike.  This guy came to Las Vegas not knowing anyone.  Knowing what it feels like to be the new kid on the block, I took it upon myself to make sure that the new guy was welcomed with open arms.  I showed Mike around, introduced him to this person and that person and decided since he only lives like 5 or so minutes away, I'd bring him with me to Coach Blitz.  Well that's when he met Laura.  Here begins the Coach Clique.  The three of us were inseparable.  If someone needed to find me, they would say, "Where's Mike & Laura?  Julie is with them!"  And that went for all of us.  Where you'd find one, you'd find three.  </p>

<p>Mike's best trait, aside from his big heart and frienship, is his way to bullshit his way through any situation.  Mike has a 75% rule.  75% of everything he says, is bullshit.</p>

<p>Next up on the cast list is Stephen.  I haven't known him for very long, but he's a good person and a good friend.  For the past couple of weeks, I've had a tough time at work.  All sorts of shit going on that's annoying.  Stephen has been such an asset and friend, he's taken on lots of different projects, has kept me laughing and also just been a good friend when I needed someone to listen to me whine, bitch & complain over the numerous idiots that we work with.</p>

<p>One of the best things about Stephen is that since he's not a Coach/Supervisor (yet), he always has a different take on things.  He also has a habit of making some crazy noises while I'm working and talking to myself.  That always makes me laugh. </p>

<p>To round out the cast, we have Tony.  Laura's husband calls him, "Big Gay Tony".  Which, really is a perfect name for him.  I'm not a good enough writer to give you all the full description of Tony.  He is so full of life.  Whenever Tony enters a room, it's like a party.  People flock to him.  I have never seen anything like it.  </p>

<p>Tony is not only a party of one, he is, just like Laura, Mike & Stephen, an integral part of my survival on the SS Clientlogic.  Tony is the social butterfly on the leto deck of the SS Clientlogic.  He is such a good friend and so damn funny, my day is not complete without one of Tony's random quotes.  Tony's 2006 catch phrase is, "Let's Get Naked & Smoke".  </p>

<p>All in all, these four are my favorite people at Clientlogic.  To Laura, Mike, Stephen & Tony, I love you all.  I couldn't get through the work day without any of you.  Thank you for being so unique, fun, loving and so fucking awesome.</p>

<p>With that said, stay tuned for our adventures!</p>

<h3 class="title">Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!</h3>

<p>This is probably going to be one of my favorite places to write.  Work, unfortunately, is where I spend most of my time, so there's lots to write about.</p>

<p>Our cat wanted her own page.  She wants to write about all the stuff she does after we let her out of the house.  Here's where you'll find those writings along with her sexy kitty pictures she takes in her free time.</p>

<h3 class="title">Family Stuff</h3>

<p>I know some of you are wondering why Danielle has her own category when she's my family, well, that's because she's in her own little world and needs a whole damn category to herself.  Here is where you'll find stuff about everyone else in my family!</p>

<h3 class="title">It's a new year!</h3>

<p>Okay I got this idea to write a book about my adventures and my crazy friends.  I decided I would start by writing here since it's been like nearly 2 years since I've written on this page.  I've got some new categories that are going to have writings about what I find interesting, funny etc.</p>

<p>The colour of this page is not going to stay.  I'm going to pick a new colour because this pink is pretty annoying.  If anyone has any ideas, please let me know! :)</p>
