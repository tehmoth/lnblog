            <p>I have recently been having problems with vodacom and wbs/iburst. I emailed them asking them what the problems might be, and cc thoes emails to one of the most brilliant minds on the planet, my good friend mothman. <br />
The responses were dissapointing, as they both assume i run windows even after stating in my emails that i run OpenBSD (a proactivly secure unix like OS)<br />
notice UNIX!!!!, the following are the email responses and teh_moths input on these issues. Well written teh_moth.</p>

            <p>VODACOM ISSUE -------<br />
Hi Gareth,</p>

<p>I find this quite the most incredibly foolish attitude on Vodacom's <br />
part.  Are they not<br />
aware of the increasing numbers of people running on Linux,Mac,Solaris,*BSD<br />
desktops  as well as the numbers of people who choose not to run <br />
Internet Explrer<br />
because of its incredibly poor security track record and poor standards <br />
support? <br />
Do they realise they are locking out an  large number of people who <br />
can't run<br />
Internet Explorer even if they wanted to? </p>

<p>The small amount of effort required to make their site cross-browser <br />
accessible<br />
(which is to say, standards-compliant, as HTML and JavaScript are well<br />
documented and standardised by ECMA and the W3C), pales in comparison to<br />
the amount of goodwill it would engender among users and developers of other<br />
operating systems and platforms but it seems that its more important to<br />
support only a browser that is the least standards compliant and ignore the<br />
rest.</p>

<p>It is sheer laziness and utter contempt for their customers that is <br />
being shown<br />
here, dictating a specific browser and operating system (as well as<br />
hardware platform).</p>

<p>Bearing that in mind I find it pretty ironic that www.vodacom.co.za is <br />
running<br />
TomCat (free software) plus JBoss (free software) on IBM HTTP Server (a<br />
derivative of Apache, which is free software) on a platform which is <br />
reported<br />
by IBM HTTP Server as  "Unix" instead of Microsoft Windows 2000/2003 with<br />
IIS and ASP/ASP.Net.  I guess alternatives are good for them but not for <br />
you.</p>

<p></p>

<p>James.</p>

<p>WBS/IBURST ISSUE --------</p>

<p>It does seem the help desk support technician did not fully read or <br />
understand the original message (perhaps they work off a script which <br />
looks for keywords like "MTU") reducing their response's usefulness <br />
significantly.  Nevertheless, the equivalent settings on OpenBSD for the <br />
"DrTcp" settings below would appear to be as follows:<br />
(using sysctl -w):<br />
net.inet.tcp.recvspace=255555<br />
net.inet.ip.mtudisc=1 (this is default)<br />
net.inet.tcp.sack=1 (default)<br />
net.inet.tcp.rfc1323=1 (window scaling, default)<br />
net.inet.ip.ttl=64 (default)</p>

<p>MTU is set on the interface with ifconfig $if mtu $newmtu<br />
(Though I would suggest to the OP that they also add<br />
scrub all fragment reassemble<br />
scrub all reassemble tcp<br />
to their packet filter configuration because of the high likelihood of <br />
packet fragmentation from WBS/iBurst.  This is not related to the issue <br />
at hand, however)</p>

<p>As seen above most of the settings outlined are essentially the default <br />
on OpenBSD (it should be noted that increasing the TCP Receive window <br />
size can have a negative impact on lossy/high latency connections as it <br />
increases the time it takes to respond to lost packets).   The rest of <br />
the settings seem to have little worth and possible negative impact on <br />
the correct functioning of the internet connection.</p>

<p>According to the instructions below, the MTU on the interface should be <br />
left as the default (1500) if it is via ethernet cable, as it is in this <br />
case (wireless ethernet though).   Please respond if this is a <br />
misunderstanding of the instructions.</p>

<p>There was no answer given as to why such a low MTU (1352) is required on <br />
the router.  This is a reasonable question as in normal cases of PPPoE <br />
connections an MTU of 1492 is sufficient to account for the overhead of <br />
the encapsulation over PPPoE.</p>

<p>This situation seems to me to be related to an upstream or router issue <br />
possibly owing to the inadvertent filtering or dropping of  ICMP.  I say <br />
upstream as the local settings on the PC have not changed (as far as I <br />
know) between the time the site was reachable and it not being <br />
reachable.   Using a direct connection to the internet and setting a low <br />
MTU does not cause any problems with accessing the site in question.  Is <br />
it possible for the Helpdesk to do the same test over their network and <br />
using their devices?</p>

<p>Does WBS/iBurst have available a device (or a means with their existing <br />
devices) to provide access to the ethernet network that their PPPoE <br />
devices connect to (i.e. not provided automatically by router, or  <br />
pseudo-dialup mode with a USB "modem") in the same way that the ADSL <br />
"modems" from Telkom do for ADSL?</p>

<p>Thanks<br />
