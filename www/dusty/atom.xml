The responses were dissapointing, as they both assume i run windows even after stating in my emails that i run OpenBSD (a proactivly secure unix like OS)<br />
notice UNIX!!!!, the following are the email responses and teh_moths input on these issues. Well written teh_moth.</p>]]>
        <![CDATA[<p>VODACOM ISSUE -------<br />
Hi Gareth,</p>

<p>I find this quite the most incredibly foolish attitude on Vodacom's <br />
part.  Are they not<br />
aware of the increasing numbers of people running on Linux,Mac,Solaris,*BSD<br />
desktops  as well as the numbers of people who choose not to run <br />
Internet Explrer<br />
because of its incredibly poor security track record and poor standards <br />
support? <br />
Do they realise they are locking out an  large number of people who <br />
can't run<br />
Internet Explorer even if they wanted to? </p>

<p>The small amount of effort required to make their site cross-browser <br />
accessible<br />
(which is to say, standards-compliant, as HTML and JavaScript are well<br />
documented and standardised by ECMA and the W3C), pales in comparison to<br />
the amount of goodwill it would engender among users and developers of other<br />
operating systems and platforms but it seems that its more important to<br />
support only a browser that is the least standards compliant and ignore the<br />
rest.</p>

<p>It is sheer laziness and utter contempt for their customers that is <br />
being shown<br />
here, dictating a specific browser and operating system (as well as<br />
hardware platform).</p>

<p>Bearing that in mind I find it pretty ironic that www.vodacom.co.za is <br />
running<br />
TomCat (free software) plus JBoss (free software) on IBM HTTP Server (a<br />
derivative of Apache, which is free software) on a platform which is <br />
reported<br />
by IBM HTTP Server as  "Unix" instead of Microsoft Windows 2000/2003 with<br />
IIS and ASP/ASP.Net.  I guess alternatives are good for them but not for <br />
you.</p>

<p></p>

<p>James.</p>

<p>WBS/IBURST ISSUE --------</p>

<p>It does seem the help desk support technician did not fully read or <br />
understand the original message (perhaps they work off a script which <br />
looks for keywords like "MTU") reducing their response's usefulness <br />
significantly.  Nevertheless, the equivalent settings on OpenBSD for the <br />
"DrTcp" settings below would appear to be as follows:<br />
(using sysctl -w):<br />
net.inet.tcp.recvspace=255555<br />
net.inet.ip.mtudisc=1 (this is default)<br />
net.inet.tcp.sack=1 (default)<br />
net.inet.tcp.rfc1323=1 (window scaling, default)<br />
net.inet.ip.ttl=64 (default)</p>

<p>MTU is set on the interface with ifconfig $if mtu $newmtu<br />
(Though I would suggest to the OP that they also add<br />
scrub all fragment reassemble<br />
scrub all reassemble tcp<br />
to their packet filter configuration because of the high likelihood of <br />
packet fragmentation from WBS/iBurst.  This is not related to the issue <br />
at hand, however)</p>

<p>As seen above most of the settings outlined are essentially the default <br />
on OpenBSD (it should be noted that increasing the TCP Receive window <br />
size can have a negative impact on lossy/high latency connections as it <br />
increases the time it takes to respond to lost packets).   The rest of <br />
the settings seem to have little worth and possible negative impact on <br />
the correct functioning of the internet connection.</p>

<p>According to the instructions below, the MTU on the interface should be <br />
left as the default (1500) if it is via ethernet cable, as it is in this <br />
case (wireless ethernet though).   Please respond if this is a <br />
misunderstanding of the instructions.</p>

<p>There was no answer given as to why such a low MTU (1352) is required on <br />
the router.  This is a reasonable question as in normal cases of PPPoE <br />
connections an MTU of 1492 is sufficient to account for the overhead of <br />
the encapsulation over PPPoE.</p>

<p>This situation seems to me to be related to an upstream or router issue <br />
possibly owing to the inadvertent filtering or dropping of  ICMP.  I say <br />
upstream as the local settings on the PC have not changed (as far as I <br />
know) between the time the site was reachable and it not being <br />
reachable.   Using a direct connection to the internet and setting a low <br />
MTU does not cause any problems with accessing the site in question.  Is <br />
it possible for the Helpdesk to do the same test over their network and <br />
using their devices?</p>

<p>Does WBS/iBurst have available a device (or a means with their existing <br />
devices) to provide access to the ethernet network that their PPPoE <br />
devices connect to (i.e. not provided automatically by router, or  <br />
pseudo-dialup mode with a USB "modem") in the same way that the ADSL <br />
"modems" from Telkom do for ADSL?</p>

<p>Thanks<br />

        <![CDATA[<p>FROM SLASHDOT<br />
techmuse writes "According to an article in Information Week, Microsoft is aware that the 'Kama Sutra/Blackworm/MyWife' worm will hit on Friday, overwriting office documents, but will not release a patch until its regular monthly patch release on February 14th. Unless, that is, you subscribe to one of Microsoft's pay security services, in which case your machine will have the worm removed in advance." From the article: "The blog offered no explanation why the tool wouldn't be updated earlier, nor did Microsoft immediately respond to questions. Each month, Microsoft pushes a revised tool to Windows users who have Automatic Update enabled for Windows Update or Microsoft Update. The Redmond, Wash.-based company has released the Malicious Software Removal Tool off-schedule once before, in August 2005, shortly after the Zotob worm began striking Windows 2000 systems."</p>]]>
        <![CDATA[<p>"Why do you want to return it?"</p>

<p>"Because there's a car bomb on it set to go off on Friday."</p>

<p>"Sorry, that's not our car bomb."</p>

<p>"No, but when I bought the car, there was a modular plug next to the engine with PLACE CAR BOMB HERE written on it!"</p>

<p>"Sorry, not our problem. You knew this car was prone to car bombs when you bought it, and your purchase agreement specifically spells out that we're not responsible for car bomb damage."</p>

<p>"Can you at least remove the car bomb?"</p>

<p>"Sorry, but your contract specifically states that we're under no obligation to remove any car bombs attached to your car. Now, if you would be interested in purchasing our special Car Bomb Insurance..."</p>

The reason i am interested in sketching is because of a friend of mine, who is an amazingly talented artist.<br />
He has deemed me unteachable tho. http://bobthefilterpuppy.deviantart.com<br />
I will attempt more sketching and post if i get anything right.</p>]]>

Well, i like Bach, and most classical music, and i like books, and i should probably read more. I really enjoy a good argument with moth! He is one of the smartest people i know, and probably one of the smartest people on the planet, so, he is always right, and erm, fun to argue with!<br />
i have found physical hard, yet mindless, work very relaxing. I made a ton of flyleads (network cables) and its the same mindless thing over and over, yet you have to put some concentration into it, cause, you have to make the colours match on both sides! i could make flyleads all day, cept for the blisters on the fingers!<br />
I must ask teh_moth something! *runs*</p>]]>
        <![CDATA[<p>Oh, the topic is books, i need really good mythical or fantasy books, nothing too dark. Things like Pendragon Cycle, and In The Halls of the Dragon King, and such books!<br />
moth has already given me a huge list, but other opinions would be welcome!<br />
